### **Problem Statement: Winning Candidate**

You are given a list of candidates participating in an election and a sequence of votes cast across multiple locations. Your task is to determine which candidate received the highest number of votes.

#### **Input Format:**
1. A single line containing the number of candidates followed by the candidate names separated by spaces.
2. A second line representing the location-wise election results as a sequence of characters (candidate names), separated by spaces.

#### **Output Format:**
- A dictionary displaying the vote count for each candidate.
- The candidate with the highest number of votes.

#### **Constraints:**
- Candidate names are single uppercase characters (A-Z).
- The number of candidates is between 1 and 26.
- The votes contain only candidate names (whitespace-separated).

#### **Example Input:**
```
Input: 3 A B C  
Location Wise Result: A B C A B B C C  
```

#### **Example Output:**
```
Results: {A=2, B=3, C=3}  
Winning Candidate: B  
```  

#### **Edge Cases to Consider:**
- If two or more candidates receive the same highest votes, return any one of them.
- If no votes are cast, return a message indicating no winner.
