                Check if One Array is a Subset of Another
                Description:
                You're given two arrays: arr1[] and arr2[].
                You need to check if all elements of arr2 are present in arr1
                Note: Arrays in sorted order

                Example 1 :-
                arr1 -[1, 2, 3, 4]
                arr2 = [2, 4, 5]
                Output = false

                Example 2:-
                arr1 -[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
                arr2 = [2, 4, 5]
                Output = true
