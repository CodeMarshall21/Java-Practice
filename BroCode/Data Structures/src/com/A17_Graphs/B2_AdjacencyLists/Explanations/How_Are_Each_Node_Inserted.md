
## 🔹 What is `LinkedList<Node>`?

Think of it as:

> A **list (chain)** where **each item** is a `Node`.

This is Java’s `LinkedList` data structure from the `java.util` package. When you write `LinkedList<Node>`, you're creating a **linked list where every element is a `Node` object**.

---

## 🔸 First, what is a LinkedList?

A `LinkedList` is a linear data structure where:
- Each **element (called a "node")** stores a **value** and a **reference to the next node**.
- Unlike an array, it doesn't store items in **contiguous memory locations**.
- You can **add or remove** elements easily from the list, especially at the beginning or middle.

### Imagine this in memory:
```
[ A | next ] → [ B | next ] → [ C | null ]
```

Here:
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are values (`Node` objects in our case),
- and each node points to the next node.

## 🔸 Now What is `LinkedList<Node>`?

Let’s go back to your code:

```java
LinkedList<Node> currentList = new LinkedList<>();
```

You're creating an empty linked list that can store `Node` objects.

Then:

```java
currentList.add(new Node('A'));
```

You're adding a `Node` object to this list — like putting a box with the letter `A` into a chain.

So now your list looks like:
```
[A]
```

### 🔹 In the Graph Context

When you do:
```java
ArrayList<LinkedList<Node>> alist;
```

You're saying:

> "I want a dynamic list (ArrayList) where each item is a **LinkedList of Node objects**."

This is your **adjacency list**:
- Each LinkedList starts with the **main node** (say, A).
- Then you **append all nodes it's connected to**.

Example after adding a few edges:
```
alist = [
   [A, B],        // Node A has an edge to B
   [B, C, E],     // Node B has edges to C and E
   [C, D, E],     // Node C has edges to D and E
   [D],
   [E, A, C]
]
```

Each inner LinkedList is:
```
[current node, all its adjacent (connected) nodes]
```

## 🔹 Analogy: Graph as Friend Lists

Imagine `Node` is a person.

- `LinkedList<Node>` = That person's **friend list**.
- `ArrayList<LinkedList<Node>>` = List of all people and their respective **friend lists**.

So:
- A's friend list = [A, B]
- B's friend list = [B, C, E]

And so on.

This is perfect for representing **graphs**, because:
- You easily know what node you're at (first item).
- You can see whom it's connected to (rest of the list).

## 🔹 Visual Explanation

Here’s how it looks under the hood for `alist` (ArrayList of LinkedLists):

```
alist index:         0             1             2             3          4
                 ┌────────┐   ┌────────┐   ┌────────┐   ┌───────┐   ┌────────┐
alist element →  [A → B]     [B → C → E]   [C → D → E]   [D]       [E → A → C]
```

- Index 0 = A and its connections
- Index 1 = B and its connections
- etc.

So `LinkedList<Node>` is used to store:
1. A main node (like A)
2. All the nodes it's connected to (like B, C)

This lets us quickly check:
- Who A is connected to
- Who B is connected to
- And so on.

## ✅ TL;DR: What is `LinkedList<Node>` Doing?

- It's storing a **list of Node objects**.
- The **first node** is the main node (like A).
- The **rest are its neighbors (adjacent nodes)**.
- You use this structure to **easily store and access graph connections**.
